    <p>I am an avid runner, and I am looking to run at least two half marathons this year. I have a few 5K runs coming up which will serve as good warms up and practices, and then have a 10K as well in April. I have only run one half-marathon before, so my goal would be to beat that time. I just have to maintain my training schedule!
        Aside from that, I also love to travel. I have been to nearly 40 countries and want to keep the list growing once I get settled into my new personal and professional life. <br>

      I am also a huge NFL fan, and I have been a fan of the Green Bay Packers since I first watched them in the 1998 Super Bowl. I also love playing video games, and I am currently replaying the Halo series on my Xbox.
