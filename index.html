      <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Kyle. I am currently a student at Columbia University's Business School<a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode"> Justice Through Code</a> which is a program that teaches justice-impacted students how to code. I am currently in the first section of the program called <em>Foundations</em> which teaches students how to be job ready, prepare for interviews and the background checks, and how to write cover letters. Additionally, we are learning the foundations of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and will be finishing with an introduction to a few other languages. If successful in this first part, I will be ready to take the assessment and move on to the second section, <em>Tech Pathways</em>. </p>

        <h1>Professional Experience and Goals</h1>
  <p> I have been fortunate to work in some very interesting roles in my life and they have taken me all across the globe. I have spent significant time in Europe and different parts of the United States, with smaller but amazingly rewarding trips to different parts of Africa and Central America. I genuinely miss working for the government in the capacity that I did, as I truly believe we were making the world a safer place. I am now currently working at a Michelin star restaurant just outside San Diego, which has been an incredible place to build community but not part of the long term plans. I am also a freelance consultant working in project management, where I am working on a software implementation project with the client switching over to Salesforce from Zendesk. My goal, particularly with this program, is to stay in the PM realm but being able to manage more technical projects</p>
