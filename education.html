    <p>I have been fortunate to have attend several different schools for different parts of my education, each of them unique in their own way. I always had a love of history and politics which is why I pursued the programs that I did. When I had to make a pivot, I was lucky to find Columbia's Justice Through Code program that is setting me up for my next career</p>
